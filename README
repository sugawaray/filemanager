* ABOUT THIS TOOL

        This tool is a simple command line file manager.

        It attaches names to files. And you can locate the files
        with the names.

        It needs a directory named '.fm' at the root of the directory
        hierachy it manages.

        * This tool is under construction. And it may not work properly.
          It may destroy files.

* ABOUT EACH COMMANDS

        This tool contains following commands.

        * fm-cp
                This command copies files to destination paths. The files at
                the destination paths have the same names as the copied files.

                fm-cp [-b .fm_directory_parent_path] source target
                fm-cp [-b .fm_directory_parent_path] [-R] source ... target

        * fm-get
                This command locates files with the given names. It locates
                the files which have all of the names.

                fm-get [-b .fm_directory_parent_path] name ...

        * fm-getcat
                This command gives names which a specified file has. It gives
                all names which this tool manages when it is called without
                any arguments.

                fm-getcat [-b .fm_directory_parent_path] 
                fm-getcat [-b .fm_directory_parent_path] file

        * fm-init
                This command creates a directory named '.fm' at the current
                working directory. It needs the directory to work.

        * fm-mv
                This command moves files to destination paths. The files
                have the same names they had before they were moved.

                fm-mv [-b .fm_directory_parent_path] source target
                fm-mv [-b .fm_directory_parent_path] source ... target

        * fm-refresh
                This command removes information this tool manages that is
                used for the files which do not exist anymore.

		fm-refresh [-b .fm_directory_parent_path] 

        * fm-rm
                This command removes specified files. The files which are
                removed by this command are not located with the names which
                they had.

                fm-rm [-b .fm_directory_parent_path] [-R] file ...

        * fm-set
                This command sets names for a specified file.

                fm-set [-b .fm_directory_parent_path] file name ...

	'-b .fm_directory_parent_path' is a common option. If commands are
	called with it, they use the specified .fm directory to operate.

* EXAMPLE

        1. At the first time, you need to call fm-init at the directory
           whose descendant directories you want to manage files with
           this tool.

                $ fm-init

        2. You attach a name to a file.

                $ fm-set ./a_file samples
                $ fm-set ./b_file samples important

        3. After that, you can locate files with the names when you call
           fm-get at the descendent path of the directory where you have
           called fm-init.

           For example.
                $ fm-get samples
           will show
                /an/absolute/path/to/a_file
                /an/absolute/path/to/b_file

           and
                $ fm-get samples important
           will show
                /an/absolute/path/to/b_file

        4. As long as you use fm-mv and fm-cp to move or copy files,
           The names you attach to a file are preserved.
