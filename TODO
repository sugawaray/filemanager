* The strings which represent relative pathes from the parent directory of
.fm directory should be expressed as a class object because the strings are
not simply relative pathes and have some implicit rules. And it should be
generally avoided that implicit rules scatter around.

* fs::copy() function does not have tests for the case of close failures.

* (DONE)avoid using string::back().
* The method to remove all names from a file should exist. I think it should
  be done by calling fm-set command without any names.
